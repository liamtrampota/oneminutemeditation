# oneminutemeditation
A meditation exercise and encouragement app that also tracks progress and gives gentle reminders

We designed the interface to be intentionally vague and non-directional, so that the experience of the app itself inspires curiousity and mindfulness.

In the short demo below, a user is guided through a short one-minute meditation, and afterwards is able to reflect on the meditation and see his or her progress.

OneMinuteMeditation is built using React Native.
